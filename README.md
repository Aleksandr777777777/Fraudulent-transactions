Overview:
This project aims to detect fraudulent banking transactions using various patterns and behaviors indicative of suspicious activity. The application leverages data analysis and visualization to highlight transactions that exhibit unusual patterns.

Fraud-patterns:
1) Night Activity Detection: Identifies transactions made between 3 AM and 5 AM.
2) High Frequency Transactions: Detects clients making an unusually high number of transactions.
3) Patterned Behavior Detection: Highlights repeated behavior in transaction timings.
4) Large Amount Transactions: Flags transactions that are significantly larger than the client's typical transaction size.
5) High Frequency Clicks: Identifies transactions made in quick succession.
6) Inconsistent Client Information: Detects discrepancies in client details across transactions.
